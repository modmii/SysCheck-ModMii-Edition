		<long_description>Homebrew application which does several checks on installed IOS and custom IOS:
    - Base IOS Detection
    - IOS Stub
    - Fake signature (aka Trucha Bug)
    - ES_DiVerify (aka ES_Identify)
    - Flash Access
    - NAND Access
    - Boot2 Access
    - USB 2.0

sysCheck generates a report on the root of the SD card (sd:/sysCheck.csv).
