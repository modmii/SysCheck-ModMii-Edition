1. Copy the "lib" and "include" folder into your "libogc" folder.  Alternatively, run "make install" from command line

2. Make these modifications to your Makefile:
-Add "-lwupc" right after "-lwiiuse" to your LIBS
-Add ",-wrap,wiiuse_register" to your LDFLAGS

3. Modify your code like this:
-Make sure to include <wupc/wupc.h> in all files you use WUPC calls
-Call "WUPC_Init" before "WPAD_Init"
-Call "WUPC_Shutdown" before "WPAD_Shutdown"
-Either use the separate calls or use WUPC_Data at the same place you would normally use the WPAD calls for your data handling
-If you use ButtonsUp, ButtonsUp and/or ButtonsHeld, make sure to call "WUPC_ScanPads" before "WPAD_ScanPads".  If you dont use any of these you can ignore "WUPC_ScanPads"

Notes:
-The X and Y-Axis are going from about -1024 to +1024, make sure you adjust your calculations to that
-The Buttons are using the same layout as the classic controller buttons, so you can use the "WPAD_CLASSIC_BUTTON_" definitions in <wiiuse/wpad.h> instead of the ones included in wupc.h
-The Battery Status goes from 0 (critical) to 4 (full)
-The "WUPC_SetPowerButtonCallback" and "WUPC_SetBatteryDeadCallback" functions will have the same effect as "WPAD_SetPowerButtonCallback" and "WPAD_SetBatteryDeadCallback" (respectively), so there is no need to use both the WPAD and WUPC versions.

Have Fun!
